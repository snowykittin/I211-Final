                <h2>Summer Sexton</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Summer, and I am one of the founders of Infinibank, a revolutionary banking institution that simplifies financial management for our clients. Before starting Infinibank,  I saw firsthand how complicated it can be for individuals and businesses to manage multiple bank accounts. In fact, I myself struggled with managing three different bank accounts, which led me to think that there must be a better way. That's why I helped create Infinibank, a bank that offers a single account that does everything you need it to do. I am proud to lead the Infinibank team and provide our clients with a banking solution that simplifies their financial lives. Thank you for considering Infinibank for your banking needs.
